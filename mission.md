# Team Mission Statement

The Kennedy RoboEagles team provides students with the opportunity to develop skills in engineering, math, science, programming, business, marketing, and leadership through participation in the FIRST Robotics Competition.  The team does so by creating an environment that encourages creative problem solving, training students in science and technology, and providing opportunities for students to develop relationships with adult professional mentors.
